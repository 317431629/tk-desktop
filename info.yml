    default_group:
        type: str
        default_value: Studio
        description: "Controls the name of the default command grouping for any
                     commands that do not match any of the values in the groups
                     setting."

    groups:
        type: list
        description: "A list of dictionaries that define what commands get puti
                     in which groups.  Each dictionary entry needs to have the
                     following keys: name - the name of the group, matches - a
                     list of strings for what commands to add to the group.

                     As commands are added to the engine, each match from the
                     group's matches list will be treated as a case insensitive
                     glob style match against the command's display name.  If
                     there is a match then the command will be added to the
                     group.  For example '*Maya*' will match against any command
                     that contains the string 'maya' in the display name,
                     regardless of case.

                     It is possible for a command to show up in multiple groups
                     if it has matches against multiple groups."
